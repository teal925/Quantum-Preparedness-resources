# Quantum-Preparedness-resources
A collection of introductory and intermediate material to help the community understand the cyber security risks forecasted due to the impending development of cryptographpically relevant quantum computers, and updates on industry &amp; government highlights from Australia and internationally.

Initially collated as additional material to support a cyber security conference presentation, I aim to update this repo regularly as the technology and governance landscape changes.
