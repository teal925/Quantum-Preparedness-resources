# Quantum-Preparedness-resources
A collection of introductory and intermediate material to help the wider community understand the cyber security risks forecasted due to the impending development of cryptographpically relevant quantum computers, and updates on industry &amp; government highlights from Australia and internationally.

Initially collated as additional material to support a cyber security conference presentation, I aim to update this repo regularly as the technology and governance landscape changes.

**Best of luck on your quantum awareness and preparedness journey and happy reading!**

## [Industry Highlights](https://github.com/teal925/Quantum-Preparedness-resources/blob/main/Industry%20Highlights.md) ##
This section aims to provide developments and newsworthy highlights from industry regarding quantum computing, and more specifically post-quantum cyber security. The scope is global and does not focus on any one country in particular.

## [Suggested Introductory and Further Reading](https://github.com/teal925/Quantum-Preparedness-resources/blob/main/Suggested%20Introductory%20and%20Further%20Reading%20Materials.md) ##
This section lists out free materials available online for those curious to find out more about cyber security implications of quantum computing, and about quantumm computing in general. The resources are separated into Basic and More Technical to cater to different levels of background knowledge.

## [Timeline - Australian Government](https://github.com/teal925/Quantum-Preparedness-resources/blob/main/Timeline%20-%20Australian%20Government.md) ##
This section aims to show the timeline of significant government actions that are being taken around quantum technologies, both in terms of promoting advancements, and in steps towards quantum resiliency for associated cyber risks. Originally centered on federal government activity, significant state government actions will also be included. As activity in this space increases, updates are expected to be quite frequent.
